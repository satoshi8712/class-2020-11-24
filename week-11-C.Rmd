# Same data clean up as last week.

## Scene 1

**Prompt:** Create a fitted model object called `fit_1` using this formula or, if you want, a formula which you prefer. I recommend not making your model execessively complex.

primary_06 ~ solo + primary_04 + treatment + solo:treatment

(Assume that you have already completed a cross-validation analysis and chosen this one model to use going forward.)

```{r sc1-a, cache=TRUE}

fit_1 <- stan_glm(formula = primary_06 ~ solo + primary_04 + treatment + solo:treatment,
                  data = week_11, 
                  refresh = 0)
```

```{r}
 print(fit_1, digits = 3)
```


* Which data set should you use to fit the model? Explain why.

* Interpret the fitted model. Should we keep all these variables? And the interaction term?



## Scene 2

**Prompt:** What is the causal effect of receiving the Neighbors postcard as compared to being in the control group? Provide a posterior probability distribution.

* One way to answer this question is to use `posterior_predict()`. Do that. Make it look nice! Write a sentence or two interpreting the answer.

* A second approach uses `posterior_epred()`. Do that. Make it look nice! Write a sentence or two interpreting the answer.


## Scene 3

**Prompt:** There are four primary causal effects of interest: each of the four treatments compared, individually, to Control.  Build a big graphic which shows the four posterior probability distributions of the expected values at once. See #preceptors-notes for my version. You do not need to copy my work! Make something better!

* Challenge question: Do the same but for both `solo = TRUE` and `solo = FALSE`. This means that there are 8 posterior probability distributions to show. Think hard about the best way to display them. What point are you trying to get across to your readers?



## Optional Question

Use a logistic model --- `stan_glm()` with `family = binomial()` --- to fit the model. How does that change the results above, especially in Scene 2. Chapter 11 provides some relevant discussion?
